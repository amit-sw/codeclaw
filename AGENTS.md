# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
This repository is currently empty (no source files or folders detected). When you add code, document the layout here. Recommended minimum structure:
- `src/`: application/library code
- `tests/`: automated tests
- `assets/`: static files (images, fixtures, etc.)

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
No build or test tooling is configured yet. When you add tooling, list the exact commands here. Examples:
- `npm run dev`: run the local dev server
- `npm test`: run the test suite
- `make build`: produce production artifacts

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
No formatter or linter is configured. Once set, document the rules here. Suggested defaults:
- Indentation: 2 spaces (JS/TS) or 4 spaces (Python)
- File naming: `kebab-case` for folders, `PascalCase` for React components
- Formatting tools: `prettier`, `eslint`, `ruff`, `black`

## Testing Guidelines
No testing framework is configured yet. When you add tests, specify:
- Framework (e.g., `vitest`, `jest`, `pytest`)
- Naming (e.g., `*.test.ts`, `test_*.py`)
- How to run tests and expected coverage targets

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
No Git history was found to infer conventions. Until established, use:
- Commit messages: short, imperative, and scoped. Example: `feat: add user signup`
- Pull requests: include a clear description, linked issue (if any), and screenshots for UI changes

## Configuration & Secrets
Do not commit secrets. Use a local `.env` for development and document required keys in `README.md` once the project is initialized.
